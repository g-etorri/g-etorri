# Guilherme Etorri
Hello! My name is Guilherme, and I’m a Network Engineer with a JNCIP-SP certification. I’m passionate about routing protocols, MPLS technologies, and everything related to network engineering.
I created this blog to share my studies, lab experiments, and personal projects, with a focus on network engineering, automation and programming.
